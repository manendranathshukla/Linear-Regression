# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression implementation on different datasets. 

All the datasets are kept in the dataset file 


import the respective dataset to work on that and predict whatever you want,for this repository I worked on google colab
so if u don't have anaconda or jupyter don't worry google have all problem solution.


So, open google colab and create new file and write the code to implement for prediction
